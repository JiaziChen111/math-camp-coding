# Math camp coding session
An introduction to coding for econ PhD students, using Julia  
20 August 2020

Contents:
1. A high-level overview and introduction to coding in economics (slides in tex and pdf format)
2. A Jupyter notebook (Julia v1.5.0) walking through the very basic features of Julia with an eye to numerical computing

Setup instructions for Julia and Jupyter:
1. Install Julia from here: http://julialang.org/downloads/
2. Open the Julia application and install IJulia by typing the ] key followed by `add IJulia`
3. Type the backspace key and then the following line of code: `using IJulia; jupyterlab()` and accept all the defaults.

If you need to troubleshoot, try [QuantEcon](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html#Desktop-Installation-of-Julia-and-Jupyter), on which these instructions are based (but which has many more steps).
